# AUDIT METHODOLOGY

The audit methodology incorporated in MSSQLSC toolkit follows a rigorous, systematic approach to ensure a comprehensive review of the MSSQL databases. It begins with the planning stage where the scope of the audit, such as specific databases or operations, is defined. Then, the data collection stage ensues, wherein MSSQLSC utilizes advanced tools to gather necessary data without disrupting the regular operations of the database. This includes extracting schemas, table structures, stored procedures, user permissions, and more. The third step involves the thorough analysis of the collected data to identify potential security vulnerabilities, performance issues, and non-compliance with standards. The methodology emphasizes transparent reporting, providing detailed reports that outline the identified issues, their potential impacts, and recommendations for remediation. Finally, it includes a review process, which encourages continuous improvements in database management practices. Throughout this whole process, MSSQLSC maintains a strong focus on data privacy and integrity, ensuring the secure handling of sensitive information.
