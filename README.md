# AUDIT METHODOLOGY

The audit methodology incorporated in the MSSQLSC toolkit embodies a rigorous and systematic approach, ensuring a comprehensive and thorough review of the MSSQL databases. This adaptable framework begins with a meticulous planning stage, where the precise scope of the audit, including specific databases or operations, is clearly defined. The subsequent data collection stage involves MSSQLSC's advanced tools working seamlessly to gather the necessary data, all while ensuring minimal disruption to the ongoing database operations. This includes a thorough extraction of schemas, table structures, stored procedures, user permissions, and more.

Upon successful data collection, a detailed analysis is performed on the gathered data to identify potential security vulnerabilities, performance issues, and any instances of non-compliance with industry standards. The methodology emphasizes the importance of transparent reporting, meticulously crafting detailed reports that not only outline the identified issues but also provide their potential impacts, along with solid recommendations for remediation.

An integral part of this methodology is the review process, an iterative cycle that encourages continuous improvements in database management practices. This process allows for the perpetual refinement and evolution of the toolkit, making MSSQLSC a dynamic auditing solution that continuously adapts to the ever-changing landscape of database security.
