## 1. INTRODUCTION AND AUDIT OBJECTIVES
The primary goal of this framework is to provide a structured, repeatable process for auditing MSSQL databases. Objectives include:  
- Identifying security vulnerabilities and misconfigurations.  
- Ensuring compliance with relevant regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS).  
- Evaluating database performance, reliability, and availability.  
- Recommending risk mitigation strategies and best practices aligned with the latest SQL Server releases (e.g., SQL Server 2022).  

---

## 2. AUDIT METHODOLOGY
The MSSQLSEC toolkit employs a rigorous, phased approach:

1. **Planning & Scoping**  
   - Define clear boundaries and objectives (e.g., which instances, databases, or features to audit).  
   - Identify stakeholders and compliance/regulatory requirements.  

2. **Data Collection**  
   - Use MSSQLSEC’s automated discovery tools and manual checks to gather configuration, security, and performance data.  
   - Minimize operational disruption while extracting necessary information (schemas, table structures, stored procedures, user permissions, etc.).  

3. **Analysis**  
   - Compare collected data against best practices, CIS Benchmarks, and the latest Microsoft documentation.  
   - Identify vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, or performance bottlenecks.  

4. **Reporting**  
   - Document findings with clear impact statements.  
   - Provide prioritized recommendations for remediation or improvement.  

5. **Remediation & Follow-Up**  
   - Support iterative improvements to continuously refine security posture.  
   - Re-audit to confirm successful remediation of identified issues.  

Throughout each step, MSSQLSEC adheres to strict data privacy standards and ensures confidentiality and integrity of the data under review.

---

## 3. SCOPE OF THE AUDIT
The scope defines which MSSQL Servers, databases, and features will be audited. This typically includes:

- **Server Infrastructure**  
  - Host operating system details (IP, MAC, clustering, virtualization).  
  - Network topology and firewall settings.  

- **Database-Level Components**  
  - Configuration (memory, parallelism, network, encryption).  
  - Security measures (access controls, roles, privileges).  
  - Backup, recovery, and high availability mechanisms.  
  - Stored procedures, functions, triggers, and associated code.  

- **Compliance and Performance**  
  - Adherence to regulatory requirements.  
  - Metrics and usage patterns affecting performance.  

**Initial System Identification**  
```sql
-- Server Name and SQL Server Instance
SELECT SERVERPROPERTY('MachineName') AS ServerName,
       SERVERPROPERTY('InstanceName') AS InstanceName;

-- SQL Server Version, Edition, and Engine
SELECT SERVERPROPERTY('ProductVersion') AS SQLServerVersion,
       SERVERPROPERTY('ProductLevel') AS SQLServerLevel,
       SERVERPROPERTY('Edition') AS SQLServerEdition,
       SERVERPROPERTY('EngineEdition') AS SQLEngineEdition;

-- Operating System Information
SELECT SERVERPROPERTY('IsClustered') AS IsClustered,
       SERVERPROPERTY('IsFullTextInstalled') AS IsFullTextInstalled,
       SERVERPROPERTY('IsIntegratedSecurityOnly') AS IsIntegratedSecurityOnly,
       SERVERPROPERTY('IsSingleUser') AS IsSingleUser,
       SERVERPROPERTY('OSVersion') AS OSVersion;
```

IP and MAC details typically come from OS-level commands:
- **Windows:** `ipconfig /all`  
- **Linux:** `ifconfig` or `ip addr`  

---

## 4. DATABASE CONFIGURATION REVIEW
A careful review of database configuration ensures alignment with best practices and the latest SQL Server capabilities.

### 4.1 Server Configuration  
- **Memory Allocation**  
  - Check `max server memory (MB)` and `min server memory (MB)`:  
    ```sql
    EXEC sp_configure 'max server memory (MB)';
    EXEC sp_configure 'min server memory (MB)';
    ```
  - Monitor memory usage with:  
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM sys.dm_os_process_memory;
    ```

- **Parallel Processing (MAXDOP)**  
  - Review `max degree of parallelism` and `cost threshold for parallelism`:  
    ```sql
    EXEC sp_configure 'max degree of parallelism';
    EXEC sp_configure 'cost threshold for parallelism';
    ```

- **Network Configuration**  
  - Validate network packet size, protocols (TCP/IP, Named Pipes), and firewall rules.  
  - Check forced encryption settings (especially in SQL Server 2022, which can be combined with TLS 1.3 in some environments).

- **Additional Parameters**  
  - `max user connections`, `query wait (s)`, `backup compression default`, etc.  
  - Check for any server-level configurations that might conflict with your organization’s policies.

### 4.2 Database Settings  
- **Database Files**  
  ```sql
  SELECT * 
  FROM YourDatabase.sys.database_files;
  ```
  - Review file growth, locations, initial sizes, and auto-grow increments.

- **Database Properties**  
  ```sql
  SELECT *
  FROM sys.databases
  WHERE name = 'YourDatabase';
  ```
  - Check compatibility level, recovery model, auto-shrink/auto-grow, collation, and options like AUTO_CLOSE or AUTO_CREATE_STATISTICS.

- **Recovery Models**  
  - Confirm recovery model (FULL, BULK_LOGGED, SIMPLE) aligns with business needs for point-in-time restores.

- **Ledger Tables (SQL Server 2022)**  
  - If tamper-evidence is required, review usage of ledger tables. Ensure the ledger is correctly configured and regularly validated.

### 4.3 Security Configuration  
- **Server Logins & Roles**  
  ```sql
  EXEC sp_helpsrvrolemember;
  ```
- **Database Users & Roles**  
  ```sql
  USE YourDatabase;
  EXEC sp_helprole;
  ```
- **Principle of Least Privilege**  
  - Verify that all logins have only required permissions.  
- **Encryption**  
  - Check Transparent Data Encryption (TDE), Always Encrypted (including enclaves in SQL 2022), or column-level encryption.  

### 4.4 Maintenance Plans  
- **Index Maintenance, Statistics Updates, DBCC CHECKDB**  
  - Confirm these tasks are scheduled regularly and stored procedures are tested.  

### 4.5 System Health Checks  
- **Review Logs**  
  ```sql
  EXEC xp_readerrorlog;
  ```
  - Check for recurring issues, corruption, or misconfigurations.

### 4.6 High Availability & Disaster Recovery  
- **Availability Groups / Clustering**  
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM sys.dm_hadr_availability_group_states;
  SELECT * FROM sys.dm_hadr_availability_replica_states;
  ```
- **Log Shipping / Replication**  
  - Verify configurations, latency, and failover testing procedures.

## 5. STORED PROCEDURES AND FUNCTIONS
Assess stored procedures and functions for security and performance:

1. **Inventory**  
   ```sql
   SELECT name, type_desc FROM YourDatabase.sys.procedures;
   SELECT name, type_desc FROM YourDatabase.sys.objects 
   WHERE type_desc LIKE '%FUNCTION%';
   ```
2. **SQL Injection Risk**  
   - Scrutinize dynamic SQL usage. Ensure parameters are properly sanitized.  
3. **Privilege Requirements**  
   - Check if procedures require elevated privileges; adhere to least privilege.  
4. **Performance Tuning**  
   - Look for inefficient queries, blocking issues, or missing indexes.  
5. **Documentation**  
   - Verify clarity on inputs, outputs, and side effects.

---

## 6. SECURITY MEASURES ANALYSIS
Assess defenses against unauthorized access and data breaches:

1. **Server-Level Security**  
   - Ensure current OS patches, antivirus definitions, and hardened firewall rules.  
2. **Database-Level Security**  
   ```sql
   SELECT pr.principal_id, pr.name, pr.type_desc, 
          pe.permission_name, pe.state_desc
   FROM sys.database_permissions pe
   INNER JOIN sys.database_principals pr 
       ON pe.grantee_principal_id = pr.principal_id;
   ```
3. **Encryption**  
   - Validate TDE, Always Encrypted configurations, check for TLS 1.2 or higher (TLS 1.3 in supporting environments).  
4. **Authentication Mode**  
   ```sql
   EXEC xp_loginconfig 'login mode';
   ```
   - Prefer Windows Authentication or secure solutions (e.g., Azure AD) with MFA.  
5. **SQL Server Ledger (SQL Server 2022)**  
   - If configured, validate the ledger’s tamper-evidence capabilities.  

---

## 7. ACCESS CONTROL REVIEW
Ensure only authorized individuals can access data or administrative functions:

   ```sql
   SELECT DP1.name AS UserName, DP2.name AS RoleName
   FROM sys.database_role_members DRM
   RIGHT OUTER JOIN sys.database_principals DP1
       ON DRM.member_principal_id = DP1.principal_id
   LEFT OUTER JOIN sys.database_principals DP2
       ON DRM.role_principal_id = DP2.principal_id
   WHERE DP1.type = 'S'
   ORDER BY DP1.name;
   ```
2. **Roles and Permissions**  
   - Match user roles to job functions; enforce least privilege.  
3. **Administrative Accounts**  
   - Minimize `sysadmin` and `db_owner` memberships. Review `sp_helpsrvrolemember 'sysadmin'`.  
4. **Inactive or Orphaned Logins**  
   - Disable or remove unused accounts.  
5. **Access to Sensitive Data**  
   - Log and monitor all sensitive data access.  

---

   FROM sys.sql_logins;
   ```
   - Check complexity requirements, expiration intervals, MFA if possible.  
3. **Certificates and Keys**  
   - Consider certificate-based or asymmetric key-based authentication for added security.  
4. **Contained Databases**  
   ```sql
   SELECT DP.name, DP.type_desc
   FROM sys.database_principals AS DP
   WHERE DP.authentication_type_desc = 'DATABASE';
   ```
   - Ensure contained database security is used appropriately.

---

   SELECT DP1.name AS UserName, DP2.name AS RoleName
   FROM sys.database_role_members DRM
   ...
   ```
2. **Permission Review**  
   ```sql
   SELECT object_name(major_id) AS Object,
          USER_NAME(grantee_principal_id) AS Grantee,
          permission_name
   FROM sys.database_permissions
   WHERE class = 1;
   ```
3. **Administrative Privileges**  
   - Monitor `db_owner`, `db_securityadmin`, and `sysadmin`.  
4. **Object-Level Permissions**  
   - Ensure only authorized roles/users can perform DML/DDL.  

---

## 10. AUDIT TRAIL REVIEW
